-------------------------------

## Bindings
There are some nice bindings available, for use in [Python](https://github.com/hcmc-project/tulipindicators-python) and [Lean](https://github.com/hcmc-project/tulipindicators-net).

## Testing

The testing process consists of three stages:
1. **`benchmark2`**: a series of 4000 bars is randomly generated, then the behavior of different implementations (plain, `ref`, `stream`) is matched against each other, and also benchmarked.
2. **`fuzzer`**: tries to find options that would trigger a segfault, memleak, of something alike.
3. **`smoke`**: we match the behavior of the indicator against precomputed values.

With debug build on Linux, these are run under sanitizers, namely `-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address -fsanitize=leak`.

## Architecture

1. **indicators.tcl**: this is the heart of the project, it's the script that generates
    + the boilerplate under `indicators/` for further indicator implementation
    + `indicators.h`
    + `indicators_index.c`
2. **indicators/xxx.c**: this is the file implementing *xxx*, namely:
    + `int xxx(int size, double **inputs, double *options, double **outputs)`
    + `int xxx_start(double *options)`  
    *and optionally,*
    + `int xxx_stream_new(double *options, ti_stream **stream)`
    + `int xxx_stream_run(ti_stream *stream, int size, double **inputs, double **outputs)`
    + `void xxx_stream_free(ti_stream *stream)`   
    *and*
    + `int xxx_ref(int size, double **inputs, double *options, double **outputs)`

# Tulip Indicators

## Introduction

Tulip Indicators is a library of technical analysis functions written in ANSI C.

Lots of information is available on the website:
[https://tulipindicators.org](https://tulipindicators.org)

High quality bindings are available for [Node.js](https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipnode),
[Python](https://github.com/cirla/tulipy), and [.NET](https://github.com/TulipCharts/tinet).

## Features

 - **C99 with no dependencies**.
 - Uses fast algorithms.
 - Easy to use programming interface.
 - Release under LGPL license.


## Building

Building is easy. You only need a decent C compiler. Tulip Indicators has no
other dependencies.

Just download the code and run `make`.

```
git clone https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipindicators
cd tulipindicators
make
```

You should get a static library, `libindicators.a`. You'll need that library
and the header file `indicators.h` to use Tulip Indicators in your code.

## Usage

For usage information, please see:
