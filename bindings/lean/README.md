# tulipindicators-net

This is a binding to our [base lib of TA indicators](https://github.com/hcmc-project/tulipindicators-private) that can be used with [Lean](https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/), our core backtesting and trading engine.

## Installation and Usage

1. download `tulipindicators-X.Y.zip` from [here](https://github.com/hcmc-project/tulipindicators-python/releases)
2. run `pip install` on it
3. run `generate-bindings.py`

Interop file `tulipindicators.cs` will be generated. Copy it together with the library binaries to where needed. (We have yet to setup packaging.)
